# --- Foundation Evaluation ---

FOUNDATION_PROMPT = """Evaluate these fantasy novel planning documents.

SCORING CALIBRATION (read this before scoring anything):

  9-10: Could not improve this with a month of focused editorial work.
        Published-novel quality. You can name the specific published
        novel it competes with. Reserve 10 for work that SURPRISES you.
  7-8:  Strong. A skilled author could draft from this document with
        minimal invention. Gaps exist but are minor and enumerable.
  5-6:  Functional but thin. A writer would need to invent significant
        material on the fly. Major gaps or generic choices.
  3-4:  Sketchy. More questions than answers. Would require heavy
        supplementation before drafting.
  1-2:  Placeholder or stub. Not usable for drafting.
  0:    Empty or missing.

  A score of 8+ requires ZERO major gaps. A score of 9+ requires
  that you genuinely struggled to find flaws. Err toward lower scores.

MANDATORY: For EVERY dimension, before scoring, you must identify:
  (a) The single biggest GAP or WEAKNESS in that area
  (b) A specific, actionable improvement that would raise the score
  If you cannot find a gap, explain why you believe one doesn't exist.

VOICE DEFINITION:
{voice}

WORLD BIBLE:
{world}

CHARACTER REGISTRY:
{characters}

OUTLINE:
{outline}

CANON (established facts):
{canon}

CROSS-CHECKS (perform these before scoring):
1. Check all example dialogue lines against ANTI-SLOP patterns:
   - Look for structural formulas repeated across characters
     ("not X, but Y" / "either X, or Y" / "there's a difference")
   - Check for AI rhetorical tics disguised as character voice
   - Deduct from character_distinctiveness if multiple characters
     share the same sentence structures
2. Check for missing NEGATIVE SPACE -- what's absent?
   - Are there gaps in the magic system that would block a specific
     plot scene? (e.g., can Cass hear lies in written documents?
     What happens during the climax -- what rule resolves it?)
   - Are there characters needed for the plot who don't exist?
   - Are there scenes the outline demands that the world can't support?
3. Check for CONVENIENT GAPS vs DELIBERATE MYSTERY:
   - Convenient: "the details are unclear" where specifics are needed
   - Deliberate: withholding information from the READER while the
     AUTHOR knows the answer. If the planning docs dodge a question
     that a writer would need answered to draft a scene, that's a gap,
     not an iceberg.
4. Check the canon for INTERNAL CONTRADICTIONS:
   - Cross-reference dates, ages, and timelines
   - Check if character abilities match magic system rules
   - Look for factual conflicts between documents

Score these dimensions (gap + improvement required for each):

LORE & WORLDBUILDING:
- magic_system: Hard rules with COSTS and LIMITATIONS per Sanderson's
  Second Law. Could a writer resolve the CLIMACTIC CONFLICT using only
  rules already established? Are costs plot-driving, not decorative?
  Are there at least 3 societal implications explored with specificity?
  Is the system TESTABLE -- could you write a courtroom scene, a
  contract negotiation, and a magical confrontation without inventing
  new rules?
- world_history: Timeline of events creating PRESENT-DAY tensions.
  Each historical event should map to a current faction conflict or
  character motivation. Decorative history (cool but plot-irrelevant)
  counts against the score, not for it.
- geography_and_culture: Locations distinct with sensory signatures.
  Cultures with specific customs that GENERATE CONFLICT. Economy that
  creates class tension. Check: could two different scenes set in two
  different locations feel meaningfully different based on what's here?
- lore_interconnection: Does changing one element force changes in
  at least two others? Test by mentally removing the magic system --
  does the political structure collapse? Does the class system change?
  If elements are modular/detachable, score low.
- iceberg_depth: Implied depth vs stated depth. But CHECK: does the
  author actually know the answers to the mysteries, or are they
  handwaving? If a planning doc says "the answer will be revealed"
  without specifying WHAT the answer is, that's a gap wearing an
  iceberg costume.

CHARACTER:
- character_depth: Wound/want/need/lie chains that are CAUSALLY LINKED
  (not just thematically associated). The lie must logically follow
  from the wound. The want must be the wrong solution to the lie.
  The need must directly oppose the want. Check each chain for
  logical gaps. Also check: are ANY characters missing wound/want/need
  chains who probably need them?
- character_distinctiveness: Remove all dialogue tags from the example
  lines. Can you identify the speaker from sentence structure alone?
  Check for REPEATED STRUCTURAL FORMULAS across characters (e.g.,
  multiple characters using "X. Not Y." or balanced antithesis).
  Check that metaphor domains don't overlap. Check that speech
  patterns reflect character background (a 14-year-old should not
  sound like a 60-year-old merchant).
- character_secrets: Each major character's secret should be something
  that, if revealed, changes the plot's trajectory. Vague secrets
  ("he knows more than he says") score lower than specific ones
  ("he knows the harmonic means X, which would invalidate Y").

STRUCTURE:
- outline_completeness: Chapters with beats, POV, emotional arc,
  try-fail cycle type. Save the Cat beats at correct % marks.
  Score 0 if empty. Score 5+ only if act structure exists.
- foreshadowing_balance: Every planted thread has a planned payoff.
  Score 0 if ledger is empty regardless of implicit threads in
  other documents -- foreshadowing must be TRACKED to count.

CRAFT:
- internal_consistency: Actively hunt for contradictions. Cross-ref
  dates, ages, character counts, named locations. Flag any case
  where documents disagree. A single major contradiction caps this
  at 6. Three or more caps at 4.
- voice_clarity: Voice definition must be specific and ACTIONABLE.
  Exemplar passages must demonstrate the voice. Anti-exemplars must
  define boundaries. Check exemplar dialogue for AI slop patterns.
  A voice doc that is beautiful but contains slop in its own examples
  is undermined -- deduct.
- canon_coverage: Facts logged, sourced, and sufficient to catch
  contradictions. Check: if a writer introduced a NEW fact in
  chapter 5, could they verify it against the canon? Is the canon
  granular enough? Are there known facts from other docs that
  AREN'T in the canon?

WEIGHTING: lore/worldbuilding 40%, character 30%, structure 20%, craft 10%.
A novel with thin worldbuilding but a complete outline is WORSE than deep
worldbuilding with an incomplete outline.

FINAL CHECK: If your overall_score is above 7, re-read your gap lists.
If any gap describes a problem that would force a writer to stop and
invent something during drafting, your score is too high. Revise down.
